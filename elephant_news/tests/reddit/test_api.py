        Florida man here. I was hanging with my Grandma and she said the quiet parts out loud but whats so frightening is the ‚ÄúI just saw it, I know it‚Äù attitude towards this shit.

Ill list examples below, her side of my family shares beliefs and her info is spoon-fed by her daughter/church/whatever news she uses now that Faux is ‚Äúwoke‚Äù.

LGBTQ & Drag Queens: She believes that they are being recruited to teach children to become trans and groom them. Also George Soros is involved, public schools are ‚Äúall groomers‚Äù.

Immigration: Apparently we hand them cash, a phone and free housing to illegal immigrants. That Homeless Veteran video REALLY worked on these morons.

Woke: To them, ‚ÄúWoke is anything not conservative, its pure evil‚Äù. The list of what to hate is so large that they use this.

Public Schools: They HATE public schools. ‚ÄúParents should get All the taxes they spent on public schools refunded so they can pay for private schools‚Äù.

Florida is gone, I‚Äôm waiting for their party to openly declare public schools are ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù but not sure if thats before or after they‚Äôd round up the ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù- which ‚Äúneeds to happen and soon‚Äù.

        So, Tiny D has made Florida a place where education, tourism, employment and healthcare are dead not a priority.

Homeownership was already not happening for any non-boomers.

Florida really is about to be the Sunset State where you go to die alone with your bigoted kin.

Edit: reworded the first part, will remove edit when ‚Äò23 data is released from a non-FL source.

They still are. But they used to be too.

Do you honestly believe that's the case? Is that really what left wing news is reporting? Its been Florida law since 94 to teach the Holocaust in all k-12 schools in Florida. Every year there is holocaust memorial week in Florida schools and just a couple years ago DeSantis passed legislation to standardize teachings that were praised by the Jewish Media. DeSantis was literally just in Israel and passed legislation to combat anti-Semitism.
